### Glucose_Charting: Automating Glucose Reading Data Extraction

This Git repository contains a Python script that utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup to automate the extraction of glucose reading data from a patient's health portal. The script interacts with the portal, logs in, navigates through pages, and scrapes glucose readings along with corresponding dates. The extracted data is then processed and documented in a text file.

### Features:
- Utilizes Selenium for automated web interaction, including login and data extraction.
- Employs BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content and extract specific data elements.
- Calculates average glucose readings and generates documentation.
- Notifies about irregular reading patterns.

This project showcases automation for retrieving glucose reading data, aiding healthcare professionals in managing patient records and providing valuable insights.
